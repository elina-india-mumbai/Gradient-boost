# Gradient-boost
To predict solar GHI/DHI/DNI using boosing algortihm
It is a  time-series  and I used gradient boost algorithm at first before applyying deep neural network.
XGBoost algorithm has the advantage that :
1.It is Highly Flexible.
2. It uses the power of parallel processing.
3.It supports regularization.
4.It is designed to handle missing data with its in-build features.
5. The user can run a cross-validation after each iteration.
